# Machine Learning Models Documentation

This directory contains the machine learning models used in the Wildlife Footprint Identifier project. The models are designed to classify wild animal footprints based on images taken by users.

## Model Overview

- **Model Architecture**: The models are built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to effectively capture the features of different animal footprints.
- **Training Process**: The models are trained on a dataset of labeled footprint images, which are preprocessed and augmented to improve generalization.

## Files

- **model.py**: Contains the architecture definition of the machine learning model.
- **train.py**: Implements the training logic, including data loading, model training, and evaluation.
- **data_preprocessing.py**: Provides functions for preprocessing the dataset before training.
- **feature_extraction.py**: Contains functions for extracting relevant features from the footprint images.

## Usage

To use the models, ensure that the necessary dependencies are installed as specified in the `requirements.txt` file. The models can be trained and evaluated using the provided scripts.

## Future Work

- Explore different model architectures and hyperparameter tuning to improve classification accuracy.
- Implement model versioning and tracking for better management of model updates.
